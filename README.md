# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

All of the Lights! is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Luis Cabral

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://gigantic-tinted-meter.glitch.me/

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- Styled game buttons in a different manner than instructed
- Changed color scheme of the overall game
- Changed amount of time the pitch plays for the buttons
- Computer randomizes pattern each time game is played
- Added 8 buttons with different tone values
- modified original tone values

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

The resources I used was my previous knowledge and experience in HTML and CSS basics, stackoverflow, and developer.mozilla.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
 
The most difficult aspect of this project was having to become familiar with JavaScript to some extent in order to understand the code that I was being asked to write and how it would function. Thankfully, JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language much like C++ so when it came to functions and arrays, although the syntax varies slightly I was able to catch on quicker. JavaScript is a language that I attempted to learn in the past however I had hated it, with this project I was able to better understand JS and its implementations in web development. I overcame this struggle and disliking of JS by simply just throwing myself into it and focusing on understanding the code that was being given to me, that way I can become familiar with its overarching concepts and apply it elsewhere. Another challenge I faced was the difference between the instructions of the assignment compared to the updated template that Glitch provides. Lastly, adding additional buttons as well as creating a function that randomizes the sequence per match was confusing. Despite using multiple resources to understand the Math.floor function, it took me a while to figure out how to call the function properly in order to have it include the number of buttons I was working with.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 
Is JS going to continue being imperative in web development especially with advancements in HTML, Python, SQL, and C++? If this project focused on the front-end of web development, what goes on in the backend? Can web development evolve beyond simply designing web pages for corporations and governments? How can web development contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? How can web development contribute to the privacy and anonymity of journalists around the globe?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 
If I were to spend more time on this code, it would be to tinker with the audio synthesizer to create trickier sounds to memorize due to similarity in tone, peel back the console to see the backend of how a web-based IDE works, and review the code I typed and see if I could make my code more efficient and compact, as well as simpler to understand. To do this, I would go back and add more comments in order to provide a clear, concise description of what each function does so that whoever reads it can look at the comments and instantly know what function does what. Commenting is an important aspect of creating a program to me because of the pressure and stress it takes off of someone else reviewing the code. It makes it more digestible as, after all, programming is just creating separate functions for each tasks and combining them into one function that calls the others to work collaboratively.
